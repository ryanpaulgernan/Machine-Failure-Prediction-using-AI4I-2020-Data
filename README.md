## Project Description

Predictive maintenance is essential in industries to maintain equipment efficiency. This project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data and predict potential failures. By doing so, it aims to minimize unexpected downtimes and enhance operational efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in sensor data.
- **Classification**: Classify equipment status as normal or failing.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using various metrics.
- **Web Application**: An interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanpaulgernan/Machine-Failure-Prediction-using-AI4I-2020-Data.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Failure-Prediction-using-AI4I-2020-Data
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Download the Latest Release

To download the latest release, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/ryanpaulgernan/Machine-Failure-Prediction-using-AI4I-2020-Data/releases) and follow the instructions for downloading and executing the necessary files.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the AI4I 2020 dataset, which includes sensor readings from various industrial machines. The dataset contains several features, including:

- Sensor measurements
- Operational conditions
- Equipment failure labels

### Data Source

The dataset can be found on the [AI4I 2020 Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/).

### Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Normalizing data
- Splitting data into training and testing sets

## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the predictive models. In this project, we utilize several evaluation metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to total instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### Evaluation Techniques

1. **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of model performance.
2. **ROC Curve**: Graphical plot illustrating the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier.

## Streamlit Application

The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the model. Users can input sensor data and receive predictions regarding potential equipment failures.

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit app, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the application in your web browser, allowing you to input data and view predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building web applications.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
